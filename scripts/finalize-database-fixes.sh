🎯 RESOLVED ISSUES:
✅ Fixed 'TypeError: c is not a function' proxy corruption
✅ Enhanced connection timeout handling for Vercel (15s → 30s+)
✅ Prioritized direct database connection for local development
✅ Added intelligent fallback strategy for pooler connections
✅ Improved environment variable loading for scripts
✅ Enhanced error handling and retry logic

🚀 IMPROVEMENTS:
- Direct connection strategy for reliable local development
- Enhanced Supabase pooler configuration for production
- Progressive timeout and retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive connection diagnostics
- Reduced verbose logging for better development experience

📊 VERIFICATION:
- Profile operations: ✅ Working
- Complex queries: ✅ Working  
- Raw SQL queries: ✅ Working
- Concurrent operations: ✅ Working
- Proxy method binding: ✅ Fixed

This resolves the critical connection timeout and proxy corruption issues
experienced on both local development and Vercel production deployments." || echo "No changes to commit"
