# Production Product Visibility Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Issue:** DES-27 - Audit Product Visibility Consistency

## Summary

✅ **GOOD NEWS:** No products are hidden using old workarounds!

All products in production are properly using the availability system.

## Detailed Findings

### Products Hidden from Customers (Using Correct Availability System)

Only 2 products are currently hidden, and both are using the **correct method** (`is_available: false`):

1. **Alfajores- Pride (6-pack)**
   - `active: true` ✓
   - `visibility: PUBLIC` ✓
   - `is_available: false` ✓
   - `item_state: ACTIVE` ⚠️ (should be SEASONAL?)

2. **Alfajores- Valentine's (10 per packet)**
   - `active: true` ✓
   - `visibility: PUBLIC` ✓
   - `is_available: false` ✓
   - `item_state: ACTIVE` ⚠️ (should be SEASONAL?)

### Old Workarounds Check

✅ **No products with `active: false`** (old hiding method)
✅ **All products have `visibility: PUBLIC`** (correct)
✅ **No products are archived**
✅ **All hidden products use `is_available: false`** (correct availability system)

## Minor Recommendation

The two seasonal products (Pride and Valentine's Alfajores) currently have:

- `item_state: ACTIVE`

Consider updating to:

- `item_state: SEASONAL`

This would be more semantically correct since they are seasonal items, though functionally they work fine with the current `is_available: false` setting.

## Conclusion

**No action required** - Production is clean! All products are properly controlled through the availability system. No manual workarounds detected.

The pre-visibility feature workarounds have been successfully migrated to the proper availability system.
