# Fix Pending Order Checkout and 404 Issues (DES-60)

## Summary

Resolves critical checkout flow issues where users with existing pending orders encountered blocking errors when attempting to complete or view their orders. This PR implements three key fixes:

1. **404 Error Fix**: Created customer-facing order details page (`/orders/[orderId]`)
2. **Authorization Fix**: Enhanced retry payment API to support guest users with email verification
3. **User Experience**: All pending order alert options now work correctly

## Problem Statement

When users had existing pending orders, the checkout flow was broken in three ways:

### Issue 1: 404 Error on "View Existing Order"

- **Symptom**: Clicking "View Existing Order" redirected to 404 error page
- **URL**: `https://development.destinosf.com/orders/5d7e7c69-343c-4a6a-acfc-4becf8c77197`
- **Root Cause**: No customer-facing `/orders/[orderId]` route existed - only admin routes

### Issue 2: Unauthorized Error on "Complete Existing Payment"

- **Symptom**: Clicking "Complete Existing Payment" triggered 401 Unauthorized error
- **Root Cause**: Retry payment API required authentication but didn't support guest checkout users

### Issue 3: Pending Order Blocking

- **Symptom**: System detected duplicate orders and blocked checkout progression
- **Status**: Working as designed - duplicate prevention is intentional (3-minute window)

## Changes Made

### 1. New Customer-Facing Order Details Page

**Files Created:**

- `src/app/(store)/orders/[orderId]/page.tsx` - Server component for order details
- `src/app/(store)/orders/[orderId]/verify/page.tsx` - Email verification for guests
- `src/components/Orders/OrderDetailsView.tsx` - Client component for rich order UI

**Features:**

- ✅ Displays complete order information (status, items, payment, fulfillment)
- ✅ Supports both authenticated and guest users
- ✅ Email verification for guest access (security)
- ✅ Retry payment functionality integrated
- ✅ Handles both regular orders and catering orders
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Authorization Logic:**

```typescript
// Authenticated users: Verify order ownership by userId
if (user) {
  const ownerId = isRegularOrder ? order.userId : cateringOrder.customerId;
  if (ownerId !== user.id) {
    notFound(); // Don't expose other users' orders
  }
}
// Guest users: Require email verification
else {
  if (!email || targetOrder.email.toLowerCase() !== email.toLowerCase()) {
    redirect(`/orders/${orderId}/verify`); // Email verification page
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Retry Payment API

**File Modified:**

- `src/app/api/orders/[orderId]/retry-payment/route.ts`

**Changes:**

- ✅ Accepts email in request body for guest verification
- ✅ Validates email matches order email for security
- ✅ Implements email-based rate limiting for guests (3 req/min)
- ✅ Maintains user-based rate limiting for authenticated users (3 req/min)
- ✅ Supports both regular orders and catering orders

**Guest Request Flow:**

```typescript
// Guest user verification
const isGuestRequest = !user && requestBody.email;

if (isGuestRequest) {
  // Verify email matches order
  if (targetOrder.email.toLowerCase() !== requestBody.email.toLowerCase()) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Email does not match' }, { status: 403 });
  }
  // Apply email-based rate limiting
  await applyUserBasedRateLimit(request, requestBody.email, {
    config: { id: 'order-retry-guest', limit: 3, window: 60 * 1000 },
  });
}
```

### 3. Component Updates

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/store/PendingOrderAlert.tsx` - Added email propagation
- `src/components/store/CheckoutForm.tsx` - Integration with alert component

**Changes:**

- ✅ Passes current user email to PendingOrderAlert component
- ✅ Includes email in retry payment request body
- ✅ Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

**Cleanup:**

- ✅ Replaced `console.error` with `logger.error` for consistency
- ✅ No `any` types used - full TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Follows existing codebase patterns

**Type Safety:**

```typescript
// Proper type definitions for order data
type RegularOrderData = {
  id: string;
  total: number;
  status: string;
  paymentStatus: string;
  // ... full type definition
  type: 'regular';
};

type CateringOrderData = {
  // ... full type definition
  type: 'catering';
};

type OrderData = RegularOrderData | CateringOrderData;
```

## Testing Performed

### Automated Tests

- ✅ **TypeScript**: Type checking passed (`pnpm type-check`)
- ✅ **Linting**: ESLint passed (`pnpm lint`)
- ✅ **Build**: Production build successful (`pnpm build`)
- ✅ **Critical Tests**: Payment and checkout tests passed

### Manual Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Authenticated User with Pending Order

1. ✅ User logs in and attempts duplicate order
2. ✅ "Pending Order Found" alert displays
3. ✅ "View Existing Order" → Shows order details page (no 404)
4. ✅ "Complete Existing Payment" → Redirects to Square checkout (no auth error)
5. ✅ "Create New Order" → Bypasses duplicate check and creates new order

#### Scenario 2: Guest User with Pending Order

1. ✅ Guest attempts duplicate order
2. ✅ "Pending Order Found" alert displays
3. ✅ "View Existing Order" → Prompts for email verification
4. ✅ Email verification → Shows order details
5. ✅ "Complete Existing Payment" → Uses email for verification, redirects to payment

#### Scenario 3: Order Types

1. ✅ Regular orders display correctly
2. ✅ Catering orders display correctly
3. ✅ Pickup orders show fulfillment details
4. ✅ Delivery orders show address
5. ✅ Shipping orders show shipping address

### Security Testing

- ✅ Email verification prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Rate limiting works for both authenticated and guest users
- ✅ Order ownership verified before displaying details
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in 404 or error responses

## Database Migrations

**None required** - This PR uses existing database schema.

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a bug fix and feature enhancement with backward compatibility.

   - Test retry payment functionality

3. **Monitor Error Logs**:
   - Check for any 404 errors on `/orders/[orderId]`
   - Check for any 401 errors on retry payment endpoint
   - Verify rate limiting is working
