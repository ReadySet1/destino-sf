# PR #33 Updates Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and features added to PR #33 (Development → Main merge).

## 📦 **Commits Added** (5 new commits)

### 1. ✅ Cache Revalidation Fixes (2 commits)

#### `ac6a487` - fix(availability): revalidate product list page after rule updates
**Problem:** Product list wasn't updating after availability rule changes
**Solution:** Added `revalidatePath('/admin/products')` to all availability server actions

#### `43dcd97` - fix(availability): force router cache refresh after rule updates
**Problem:** Client-side router cache still showed stale data even after server revalidation
**Solution:** Added `router.refresh()` calls in AvailabilityForm after successful updates

**Impact:**
- Users now see updated availability states immediately
- No more stale "view only" badges after changing to "Pre-Order"
- Fixes the persistent cache bug reported in testing

### 2. 📚 Cache Debugging Infrastructure (1 commit)

#### `52c9b75` - docs(cache): add cache debugging utilities and comprehensive guide
**Added Files:**
- `src/lib/cache/cache-debugger.ts` - Utility functions for cache debugging
- `CACHE_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

**Features:**
- `getCacheDebugInfo()` - Get cache status and headers
- `logCacheDebug()` - Console logging for development
- `getCacheBustParam()` - Generate cache-busting timestamps
- `getNoCacheHeaders()` - Headers for cache control
- Complete documentation for all 4 Next.js 15 cache layers

**Use Cases:**
- Diagnose which cache layer is causing stale data
- Verify cache invalidation is working correctly
- Alternative strategies if primary fix doesn't work

### 3. ✨ Bulk Manage Enhancements (2 commits)

#### `75ce758` - feat(availability): add create new rule option to bulk modal
**Problem:** Users had to navigate separately to create new rules, losing their product selection
**Solution:** Added "Create New Rule" button to Bulk Manage modal with product pre-selection

**Features:**
- "New Rule" button when no existing rules found
- "Don't see the rule you need?" callout in main modal
- Seamless transition to bulk editor with products pre-selected
- Products preserved via URL query params

**User Flow Improvement:**
```
Before: 7 steps (with manual re-selection)
After: 5 steps (automatic pre-selection)
Saved: 2 navigation steps + manual re-selection!
```

#### `bf76274` - feat(availability): show pre-selected products at top of bulk editor
**Problem:** Pre-selected products were buried in alphabetical list
**Solution:** Auto-sort selected products to top with visual indicators

**Features:**
- Selected products appear first (sorted alphabetically)
- "Pre-selected from bulk manage" badge
- 4px blue left border on pre-selected product rows
- Dynamic re-sorting when users select/deselect products

**Impact:**
- Zero scrolling needed to see pre-selected products
- Clear visual feedback with badge and border
- Better continuity from bulk modal → bulk editor

### 4. 🔧 CI/CD Fix (1 commit)

#### `d748cb1` - fix(ci): add Supabase environment variables to Lighthouse workflow
**Problem:** Lighthouse CI builds failing with missing Supabase environment variables
**Error Messages:**
```
Missing Supabase environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: undefined
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Missing
```

**Solution:** Added required environment variables to both Lighthouse jobs:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**Fixed Workflows:**
- ✅ Lighthouse Performance Audit (Desktop)
- ✅ Lighthouse Mobile Performance

**Impact:**
- Builds now complete successfully
- Performance testing can proceed
- PR #33 CI/CD pipeline fully functional
