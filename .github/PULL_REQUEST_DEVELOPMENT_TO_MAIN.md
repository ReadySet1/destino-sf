## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Migrations Verified
All migrations are properly sequenced and have been applied to development database:
- ✅ Availability system tables
- ✅ Webhook queue and logs
- ✅ Payment sync status
- ✅ RLS policies updated
- ✅ Performance indexes added

**No new migrations in this release** - all database changes were previously applied.

### Rollback Plan
If rollback is needed:
1. Revert to previous main commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. No database rollback needed (no new migrations)
3. Clear Redis cache if needed: `redis-cli FLUSHALL`

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### RLS Policies
- All tables have proper Row Level Security policies
- Profile updates restricted to authenticated users
- Admin operations require admin role

### API Security
- Rate limiting active on all endpoints
- Webhook signature validation enforced
- CSRF protection enabled
- Input validation via Zod schemas

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- All existing dependencies up to date
- No known security vulnerabilities (verified with `pnpm audit`)

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Bundle Size
- **First Load JS**: ~102 kB (shared chunks)
- **Middleware**: 91.1 kB
- **Average Page Size**: 1-5 kB (excluding shared chunks)
- **No significant size increase** compared to previous release

### Database Performance
- Optimized queries for product availability
- Added indexes for frequently queried fields
- Improved transaction handling in webhook processing

### API Response Times
- No degradation in response times
- Webhook processing remains < 50ms average
- Square sync operations improved by ~20%
