## üìä Best Practices

### Zone Configuration Strategy

#### Catering Zones
1. **Start with major metro areas**
2. **Set realistic minimums** that cover delivery costs
3. **Account for travel time** in delivery estimates
4. **Use geographic clusters** to optimize routes

#### Regular Zones  
1. **Balance coverage with profitability**
2. **Offer free delivery thresholds** to increase order size
3. **Keep fees reasonable** for individual customers
4. **Ensure quick delivery times** for competitive advantage

### Postal Code Management
- **Be comprehensive**: Include all codes in service areas
- **Avoid overlaps**: Each postal code should belong to one zone
- **Regular updates**: Add codes as service expands
- **Validation**: Test with real customer addresses

### Pricing Strategy
- **Cover actual costs**: Factor in driver time, fuel, vehicle wear
- **Competitive analysis**: Research local market rates
- **Value perception**: Balance fees with service quality
- **Profitability**: Ensure margins support business goals
