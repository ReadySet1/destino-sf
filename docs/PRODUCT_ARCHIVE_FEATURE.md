# Product Archive Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the newly implemented product archive feature that integrates with Square's native `is_archived` field to provide proper product lifecycle management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**New Fields Added to `products` Table:**
- `is_archived` (BOOLEAN, NOT NULL, DEFAULT false) - Archive status flag
- `archived_at` (TIMESTAMP, NULLABLE) - When product was archived
- `archived_reason` (VARCHAR(100), NULLABLE) - Why product was archived

**New Index:**
- `idx_products_archived_active` on `(is_archived, active)` - Optimizes archive queries

### 2. Square Sync Integration

**What Changed:**
- Square's `is_archived` field is now checked during sync
- Products marked as archived in Square → automatically archived in database
- Archive status syncs bidirectionally with Square

**Archive Reasons:**
- `square_archived` - Archived in Square dashboard by James
- `removed_from_square` - Product no longer exists in Square catalog
- `manual` - Manually archived by admin via API

### 3. Archive Handler Updates

**Enhanced Functions:**
- `archiveRemovedSquareProducts()` - Now sets archive fields when archiving
- `restoreArchivedProduct()` - Properly restores all archive fields
- `getArchivedProductsCount()` - Returns statistics by category AND reason

### 4. New API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `/api/admin/products/[id]/archive`

#### Archive a Product
```http
POST /api/admin/products/[id]/archive
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Product \"Alfajores\" has been archived",
  "product": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Alfajores",
    "squareId": "SQUARE_ID",
    "isArchived": true,
    "archivedAt": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "archivedReason": "manual",
    "active": false
  }
}
```

#### Restore (Unarchive) a Product
```http
DELETE /api/admin/products/[id]/archive
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Product \"Alfajores\" has been restored",
  "product": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Alfajores",
    "squareId": "SQUARE_ID",
    "isArchived": false,
    "archivedAt": null,
    "archivedReason": null,
    "active": true
  }
}
```

#### Get Archive Status
```http
GET /api/admin/products/[id]/archive
```

## How It Works

### Product Lifecycle States

A product can now be in one of these states:

1. **Active** (`active: true, isArchived: false`)
   - Normal, available for purchase
   - Visible in product listings

2. **Archived** (`active: false, isArchived: true`)
   - Hidden from product listings
   - Preserved in database with archive metadata
   - Can be restored

3. **Inactive** (`active: false, isArchived: false`)
   - Temporarily unavailable
   - Not showing in Square at all locations
   - Different from archived

### Square Integration Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Square Catalog Sync] --> B{Check is_archived}
    B -->|true| C[Set isArchived=true]
    B -->|false| D[Set isArchived=false]
    C --> E[Set active=false]
    C --> F[Set archivedReason='square_archived']
    C --> G[Set archivedAt=now]
    D --> H[Product remains active]
```

### Archive Reasons Explained

| Reason | Description | How It Happens |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `square_archived` | Archived in Square dashboard | James archives product in Square → sync picks it up |
| `removed_from_square` | Product deleted from Square | Product no longer appears in catalog sync |
| `manual` | Manually archived by admin | Admin uses archive API endpoint |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Archive a Product via API

```typescript
// Archive product
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/products/abc-123/archive', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.message); // "Product \"Alfajores\" has been archived"
```

### Example 2: Restore an Archived Product

```typescript
// Restore product
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/products/abc-123/archive', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.message); // "Product \"Alfajores\" has been restored"
```

### Example 3: Query Archived Products

```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db-unified';

// Get all archived products
const archivedProducts = await prisma.product.findMany({
  where: {
    isArchived: true
  },
  include: {
    category: true
  }
});

// Get products archived from Square
const squareArchivedProducts = await prisma.product.findMany({
  where: {
    isArchived: true,
    archivedReason: 'square_archived'
  }
});

// Get active products only (exclude archived)
const activeProducts = await prisma.product.findMany({
  where: {
    active: true,
    isArchived: false
  }
});
```

### Example 4: Get Archive Statistics

```typescript
import { getArchivedProductsCount } from '@/lib/square/archive-handler';

const stats = await getArchivedProductsCount();

console.log(stats);
// {
//   total: 15,
//   byCategory: {
//     "CATERING- APPETIZERS": 3,
//     "CORE PRODUCTS- Alfajores": 5,
//     "CATERING- SHARE PLATTERS": 7
//   },
//   byReason: {
//     "square_archived": 8,
//     "removed_from_square": 4,
//     "manual": 3
//   }
// }
```

## Important Notes

### For James (Square Dashboard)

1. **Archiving in Square:**
   - When you archive a product in Square dashboard, it will automatically be archived in our database on the next sync
   - The product will be hidden from the website
   - Archive reason will be `square_archived`

2. **Restoring in Square:**
   - If you unarchive a product in Square, the next sync will restore it in our database
   - The product will become visible on the website again

### For Developers

1. **Default Queries Should Exclude Archived:**
   ```typescript
   // GOOD - Excludes archived products
   const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
     where: {
       active: true,
       isArchived: false
     }
   });

   // BAD - Might include archived products
   const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
     where: {
       active: true
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Archive vs. Delete:**
   - Never hard-delete products
   - Always use archive instead
   - Archived products preserve order history

3. **Testing Archive:**
   ```bash
   # Archive a product
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/products/PRODUCT_ID/archive

   # Restore a product
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/admin/products/PRODUCT_ID/archive

   # Check status
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/products/PRODUCT_ID/archive
   ```

## Database Migration

The migration has been applied to the database with the following changes:

```sql
-- Add archive fields
ALTER TABLE products
  ADD COLUMN is_archived BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMP,
  ADD COLUMN archived_reason VARCHAR(100);

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_products_archived_active ON products(is_archived, active);
```

**Migration File:** `prisma/migrations/20250110000000_add_product_archive_fields/migration.sql`

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What happens to existing orders with archived products?**
A: Nothing. Orders preserve the product data at time of purchase. Archiving only affects new orders and visibility.

**Q: Can customers see archived products?**
A: No. Archived products are filtered out of all customer-facing queries.

**Q: What's the difference between `active: false` and `isArchived: true`?**
A:
- `active: false` means product is temporarily unavailable (might be out of stock, seasonal, etc.)
- `isArchived: true` means product is permanently archived with metadata about when/why

**Q: How do I restore a product archived in Square?**
A: Unarchive it in the Square dashboard. The next sync will automatically restore it in our database.

**Q: Can I manually archive a product that's active in Square?**
A: Yes, using the API endpoint. However, the next sync from Square might restore it if it's still active there.

## Support

For questions or issues:
- Check logs: `logger.info` statements track all archive operations
- Review archive statistics: `getArchivedProductsCount()`
- Verify database: Check `is_archived`, `archived_at`, `archived_reason` columns

- Archived page is a server component
- Minimal client components (only for interactivity)

✅ **Form Design System**
- Used FormHeader, FormActions, FormButton
- Used FormSection with variant colors
- Used FormIcons for consistent iconography

✅ **URL State Management**
- Archive filter uses search params
- Pagination persists through filters
- Router.push() for navigation

✅ **Styling Consistency**
- White cards: rounded-xl, shadow-sm, border-gray-200
- Amber colors for archive warnings
- Responsive grids: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
- Consistent spacing: space-y-8, gap-4, p-6

✅ **TypeScript Strict Mode**
- All props properly typed
- No any types
- Proper async/await handling

### User Experience Highlights

**Visual Feedback:**
- Archived products clearly distinguishable (grayscale + dimmed)
- Color-coded badges for quick scanning
- Loading states prevent double-clicks
- Toast notifications confirm actions

**Navigation:**
- Clear breadcrumb navigation
- Count badges show archived totals
- URL state makes sharing/bookmarking easy

**Performance:**
- Pagination prevents overwhelming data loads

- [x] Filter shows/hides correct products
- [x] Statistics display correct counts
- [x] Archive badge appears on archived products
- [x] Visual dimming effect works
- [x] Pagination works correctly
- [x] Empty state displays when no results
- [x] Toast notifications appear
- [x] Loading states prevent race conditions
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [x] URL state persists across page refreshes

### Known Limitations

**Deferred to Phase 3:**

- Could add export to CSV functionality

### Lessons Learned

**What Worked Well:**
- Following established patterns made implementation smooth
- Server components reduced complexity
- Form Design System provided consistency
- TypeScript caught bugs early

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Could add more granular loading states
- Could implement optimistic UI updates
- Could add undo functionality
