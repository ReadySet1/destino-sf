### **High Priority Tasks (Address First)**

#### 1\. Correct Dry Run Reporting Logic

- **Priority:** **High**
- **Problem:** The summary report after a `[DRY RUN]` is misleading. It incorrectly states `Total items processed: 0`, which could cause an administrator to believe the sync isn't working correctly.
- **Proposed Solution:**
  1.  In the API route `/api/square/unified-sync`, locate the logic that generates the final `Sync Report Summary`.
  2.  When the `dryRun` flag is `true`, ensure the counters for "items processed" and "duplicate items" (or a new "items to be synced" counter) are incremented appropriately. The "successfully synced" count should correctly remain `0`.
  3.  The goal is for the dry run summary to accurately reflect the number of items it _would have_ processed, providing a trustworthy preview.
- **Estimated Effort:** **Small** (This is likely a minor logic change in the reporting function).
- **Benefit:** Builds administrator confidence by providing an accurate and reliable preview of changes.

#### 2\. Investigate and Improve Initial Page Load Performance

- **Priority:** **High**
- **Problem:** The first load of the `/catering` page takes over **7.5 seconds**. This creates a poor user experience for any visitor who arrives on a "cold" server (i.e., after a deployment or a period of inactivity).
- **Proposed Solution:**
  1.  **Profile the page:** Use `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` in your `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function on the `/catering` page to measure exactly how long the data fetching (`Prisma` calls) is taking versus the page rendering.
  2.  **Implement Caching:** Based on the findings, implement a caching strategy. The best choice for a product catalog like this is likely **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**.
      - Change `getServerSideProps` to `getStaticProps`.
      - In `getStaticProps`, return a `revalidate` time (e.g., `revalidate: 3600` to rebuild the page at most once per hour). This will serve a super-fast static page to users while automatically updating the data in the background.
- **Estimated Effort:** **Medium** (Requires understanding and implementing Next.js data fetching strategies).
- **Benefit:** Dramatically improves the perceived speed and professionalism of the website for all users.

### **Medium Priority Tasks (Important for Maintainability)**

#### 3\. Clean Up Application Logging

- **Priority:** **Medium**
- **Problem:** Many log lines end with `undefined` (e.g., `[INFO] ℹ️ Syncing 9 categories undefined`). This indicates a minor bug in the logging code and makes logs harder to read during future debugging.
- **Proposed Solution:**
  1.  In the `/api/square/unified-sync` file, search for all calls to your logger function (e.g., `logger.info(...)`).
  2.  Identify which calls are passing an extra, uninitialized variable as an argument.
  3.  Correct these calls by either removing the extra argument or ensuring it contains a valid value.
- **Estimated Effort:** **Small** (This is a quick find-and-fix task).
- **Benefit:** Improves code quality and makes future troubleshooting faster and more efficient.
