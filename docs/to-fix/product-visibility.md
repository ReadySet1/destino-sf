1. **Day 1-2:** Notification System (Phase 4.2)
2. **Day 3-4:** Complete Testing (Phase 6.1)
3. **Day 5:** Documentation & Deployment

## üéØ **Success Metrics**
- [ ] All products correctly filtered by visibility rules
- [ ] Admin can create/edit visibility rules without code changes
- [ ] Automated state changes work reliably
- [ ] Zero visibility-related customer complaints
- [ ] Page load time < 200ms with visibility checks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Performance:** Implement aggressive caching for evaluation results

3. **Square Sync:** Always preserve manual overrides
4. **User Experience:** Clear messaging about product availability

## üìä **Estimated Total Time**
- **Core Development:** 35-45 hours
- **Testing & QA:** 8-10 hours
- **Documentation:** 4-5 hours
