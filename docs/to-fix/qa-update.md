## 📝 Quick Fix Scripts

Create these helper scripts:

```bash
# scripts/fix-types.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Fixing common type issues..."
# Add @ts-ignore to non-critical type errors temporarily
find src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "TS2339\|TS2345" | head -20

# scripts/mock-third-party.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Creating third-party mocks..."
mkdir -p src/__mocks__/{square,shippo,@supabase}
# Generate mock templates

# scripts/validate-env.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Validating environment variables..."
tsx scripts/validate-sandbox-env.ts
```

This tailored plan focuses on your specific codebase structure, prioritizing the Square/Shippo/Supabase integrations that are central to your e-commerce platform, with clear daily objectives and commands specific to your package.json scripts.
