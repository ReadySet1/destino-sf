# Product Recommendations Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

The "You Might Also Like" section on product detail pages was showing catering products with $0.00 prices alongside regular products. This created a poor user experience and confusion about pricing.

## Root Cause

1. **Mixed Product Categories**: Catering products (with $0.00 prices) were incorrectly categorized in regular product categories
2. **No Filtering**: The API and components weren't filtering out catering products from regular product recommendations
3. **Category Assignment Issues**: Individual empanadas ($0.00) were in the regular "EMPANADAS" category instead of a catering category

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Enhancement (`src/app/api/products/route.ts`)

- Added `excludeCatering` parameter (defaults to `true`)
- Automatically excludes categories starting with "CATERING" from regular product queries
- Prevents catering products from appearing in regular product listings

### 2. Component Updates (`src/components/Products/ProductDetails.tsx`)

- Updated `RelatedProducts` component to use `excludeCatering=true`
- Added additional price filtering to remove $0.00 products
- Increased limit to 6 products before filtering to ensure 3 valid products remain

### 3. Category Page Fixes

- Updated category pages to exclude catering products
- Updated main products page to exclude catering products
- Ensures clean separation between regular and catering products

### 4. Database Corrections

- Moved $0.00 empanadas from "EMPANADAS" to "EMPANADAS- OTHER" category
- Moved individual alfajores ($2.50) from "ALFAJORES" to "CATERING- DESSERTS" category
- This separates retail products (packaged items) from catering products (individual items)

## Documentation Created

- `docs/features/ecommerce/product-recommendations.md` - Comprehensive guide for preventing this issue
- Includes testing checklist, troubleshooting steps, and code examples

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Product detail pages show only valid products in "You Might Also Like"
- [x] No $0.00 products appear in recommendations
- [x] Category pages exclude catering products
- [x] Main products page excludes catering products
- [x] Catering products are properly categorized

## Prevention Measures

1. **API Defaults**: `excludeCatering=true` is the default for all product queries
2. **Price Filtering**: Additional client-side filtering removes $0.00 products
3. **Category Separation**: Clear distinction between regular and catering categories
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for developers to follow

## Future Considerations

1. **Square Sync**: Ensure future syncs properly categorize products
2. **Monitoring**: Add alerts for products with $0.00 prices in regular categories
3. **Testing**: Add automated tests for product recommendation filtering
4. **Catering Pages**: Create dedicated pages for catering products if needed
