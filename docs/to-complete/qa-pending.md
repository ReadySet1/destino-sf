# QA Improvement Plan - PRODUCTION READINESS UPDATE ðŸš¨

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS - MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### âœ… Phase 0: Fix Failing Tests (COMPLETED)
- **src/app/api/webhooks/square/route.test.ts** - âœ… FIXED
  - âœ… Fixed: `ReferenceError: importing file after Jest environment torn down`
  - âœ… Fixed: `Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms`
  - âœ… Added proper cleanup in `afterEach()` for webhook queue
  - âœ… Ensured all promises are awaited
  - âœ… Used proper mocking to prevent async operations during test teardown
  - âœ… Updated tests to match new async webhook implementation

### âœ… Phase 1: Fix 0% Coverage Discrepancies (COMPLETED)
- **src/app/actions/orders.ts** - âœ… FIXED
  - âœ… **Coverage improved from 0% to 64.39% statements, 65.1% lines**
  - âœ… **Created comprehensive test suite with 18 passing tests**
  - âœ… **Fixed issue: Tests were mocking the actual functions instead of testing real implementation**
  - âœ… **Created new test file `orders-real.test.ts` that tests actual code paths**
  - âœ… **Tests cover: order creation, payment updates, validation, error handling**
  - âœ… **All major functions now have proper test coverage**
  - âœ… **Database operations, Square API integration, and validation logic tested**

### ðŸ”´ Phase 2: Fix Remaining Coverage Issues
- **src/app/api/checkout/** - Shows 0% coverage
  - Investigate why tests aren't executing code
  - Check if module is being fully mocked
  - Fix until realistic coverage achieved

### ðŸ”´ Phase 3: Fix Performance Issues
- **src/lib/square/** - Shows 0% coverage
  - Investigate why tests aren't executing code
  - Check if module is being fully mocked
  - Fix until realistic coverage achieved

## SUMMARY OF PROGRESS

### âœ… **Phase 0 & 1 COMPLETED** - Major Test Infrastructure Improvements
1. **Fixed Critical Async Issues** - Webhook tests now pass without environment teardown errors
2. **Achieved Real Test Coverage** - Orders module went from 0% to 64.39% coverage
3. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite** - 18 passing tests covering all major functionality
4. **Fixed Mocking Strategy** - Tests now execute actual implementation instead of mocked functions
5. **Improved Test Reliability** - Proper cleanup and async handling throughout

### ðŸ“Š **Current Coverage Status:**
- **Webhook Tests**: âœ… All passing, proper async handling
- **Orders Module**: âœ… 64.39% statement coverage, 65.1% line coverage
- **Checkout API**: ðŸ”´ 0% coverage (Phase 2)
- **Square Library**: ðŸ”´ 0% coverage (Phase 3)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps:**
1. **Phase 2**: Fix checkout API coverage issues
2. **Phase 3**: Fix Square library coverage issues
3. **Final Review**: Ensure all critical paths are tested before deployment

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Phase 1 Achievements:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Other test files were globally mocking the orders module
- **Solution Implemented**: Created isolated test file with `jest.unmock()` to test real implementation
- **Coverage Areas**: Order creation, payment processing, validation, error handling, database operations
- **Test Quality**: Comprehensive edge case testing, proper mocking of dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Clear test structure, proper setup/teardown, meaningful assertions

### Test Infrastructure Improvements:
- **Environment Setup**: Proper environment variable configuration for tests
- **Mocking Strategy**: Selective mocking of dependencies while testing real business logic
- **Error Handling**: Tests for both success and failure scenarios
- **Database Integration**: Proper Prisma mocking with realistic data structures
- **API Integration**: Square API mocking with realistic responses
