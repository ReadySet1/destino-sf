# QA Improvement Plan - PRODUCTION READINESS UPDATE 🚨

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS - MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### 🔴 Phase 0: Fix Failing Tests (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
- **src/app/api/webhooks/square/route.test.ts** - CRITICAL ASYNC BUG
  - Fix: `ReferenceError: importing file after Jest environment torn down`
  - Fix: `Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms`
  - Add proper cleanup in `afterEach()` for webhook queue
  - Ensure all promises are awaited
  - Use `jest.runAllTimers()` if using fake timers

### 🔴 Phase 1: Fix 0% Coverage Discrepancies
- **src/app/actions/orders.ts** - Shows 0% despite "basic tests created"
  - Investigate why tests aren't executing code
  - Check if module is being fully mocked
  - Fix until realistic coverage appears

### 🔴 Phase 2: Complete Partial Test Suites
- **src/lib/alerts.ts** - Only 3/30 tests active
  - Activate and fix remaining 27 tests
  - Achieve full test suite completion

## CURRENT STATUS: ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

### Test Results Summary:
- **47 failed test suites** (was 50)
- **527 failed tests** (unchanged)
- **Coverage: 20.3%** (was 19%)
- **Exit code: 1** (build failing)

### Deployment Decision: **HALT DEPLOYMENT**
- Test suite is failing
- Known async bugs in webhook handling
- False security from "basic tests" with 0% coverage
- Risk of data loss and server instability

## REVISED TIMELINE TO PRODUCTION

### Week 1: Stabilize Test Suite
1. Fix webhook async errors
2. Resolve 0% coverage issues
3. Achieve green test suite (0 failures)

### Week 2: Complete Critical Coverage
- Finish all deferred webhook tests
- Complete orders.ts comprehensive tests
- Activate all 30 alerts.ts tests

### Week 3: Production Readiness Review
- All tests passing
- Coverage >40% minimum
- No async leaks
- Zero-tolerance policy enforced

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR DEPLOYMENT
- ✅ All tests passing (0 failures)
- ✅ No async errors or timeouts
- ✅ Real coverage metrics (no 0% with tests)
- ✅ Jest exit code: 0
- ✅ Coverage thresholds met

**DO NOT DEPLOY UNTIL ALL CRITERIA MET**
