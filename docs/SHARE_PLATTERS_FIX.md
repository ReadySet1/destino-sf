# Share Platters Images Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
All 6 share platter items in the "CATERING- SHARE PLATTERS" category had no images:
- All had `imageUrl: null` and `squareImageUrl: null`
- No Square Product IDs assigned
- Showing generic placeholder or "No image" in the interface

## Solution Applied
Found matching product images in the products table and applied them:

### Images Applied
| Platter Type | Image Source | Applied To |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Cheese & Charcuterie** | `cheese & charcuterie platter` product | Both Small & Large variants |
| **Plantain Chips** | `plantain chips platter` product | Both Small & Large variants |
| **Cocktail Prawn** | `tiger prawns` product (closest match) | Both Small & Large variants |

### Updated Items
1. ✅ **Cheese & Charcuterie Platter - Small** ($150.00)
2. ✅ **Cheese & Charcuterie Platter - Large** ($280.00)
3. ✅ **Plantain Chips Platter - Small** ($45.00)
4. ✅ **Plantain Chips Platter - Large** ($80.00)
5. ✅ **Cocktail Prawn Platter - Small** ($80.00)
6. ✅ **Cocktail Prawn Platter - Large** ($150.00)

## Results
- ✅ **6/6 share platter items now have images** (100% coverage)
- ✅ **All use high-quality S3 product images**
- ✅ **Both small and large variants of each platter type use the same base image**
- ✅ **Images are appropriate and representative of the actual products**

## Notes
- The cocktail prawn platters use the tiger prawns image as the closest available match
- All images are from the existing products table, ensuring consistency
- Both size variants (Small/Large) of each platter type share the same image, which is appropriate since they're the same item in different quantities

The share platters should now display properly with their respective images in the catering interface.
