# QA Report – TypeScript Compatibility Fixes (2025-09-25)

## Overview
Recent fixes addressed TypeScript build failures originating from the latest Square SDK typings and stricter component type constraints. Changes focused on:
- Normalising Square catalog request payloads and image metadata access.
- Ensuring utility types extend `Record<string, any>` where required.
- Updating React component factory helpers to use `React.JSX.Element`.

## Test & Verification Summary
- `pnpm build` ✅
  - Observed expected Prisma connection warnings when the Supabase database is unreachable in CI-like environments.
  - Build completed successfully and produced static assets for all routes.
- No unit/integration test suites were executed (unchanged). Existing Jest configuration still references watch plugins unavailable in CI; deferring remediation since scope is TypeScript compatibility.

## Risk Assessment
- **Runtime Risk:** Low. Adjustments cast Square catalog objects to `any` only at integration boundaries where upstream SDK typing is overly strict.
- **Build Risk:** Low. Fixes are limited to development-time type checks; production behaviour remains unchanged.
- **Follow-up:** Consider re-enabling formal test suites once `jest-watch-typeahead` dependency is restored or removed from config.

## Recommendations
1. Monitor future SDK updates for stronger typings to replace temporary `as any` casts.
2. Add non-interactive Jest runner configuration to catch regressions automatically.
3. Verify Prisma connectivity in CI/Vercel by confirming database credentials and network access prior to build.
