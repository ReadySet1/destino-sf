# Prisma Connection Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Production was experiencing critical database connection failures with the following errors:

- `"Engine is not yet connected"`
- `"Response from the Engine was empty"`

These errors were occurring in Vercel's serverless environment when using Supabase pooler connections.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Prisma Engine Initialization**: The Prisma client was not explicitly connecting the engine in serverless functions
2. **Connection Timing**: Race condition where queries were attempted before the engine was ready
3. **Error Recovery**: Insufficient client reinitialization on connection failures
4. **Serverless Environment**: Missing proper initialization handling for cold starts

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prisma Client Initialization (`src/lib/db-unified.ts`)

- **Added explicit `$connect()` call** during client creation
- **Connection verification** with health check query after initialization
- **Proper async initialization** with promise-based management
- **Lazy loading proxy** to ensure client is ready before use

### 2. Improved Connection Management

- **Enhanced `ensureConnection()`** to force client reinitialization on failures
- **Better error detection** for connection-related issues
- **Progressive backoff with jitter** for retry attempts
- **Client cleanup and reinitialization** on connection errors

### 3. Robust Retry Logic

- **Updated `withRetry()`** to ensure client initialization before operations
- **Force client reset** on connection errors to prevent stale connections
- **Better error classification** to distinguish connection vs. application errors
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging connection issues

### 4. Optimized Database URL Parameters

- **Supabase pooler optimization** with proper timeout settings
- **Production-specific settings**: 240s pool timeout, 45s statement timeout, 90s socket timeout
- **pgBouncer compatibility**: disabled prepared statements and statement cache
- **Regional consistency**: ensuring correct pooler region matching

## Key Changes Made

### Before:

```typescript
// Synchronous client creation without explicit connection
const client = new PrismaClient({
  /* config */
});
export const prisma = client;
```

### After:

```typescript
// Async client creation with explicit connection and verification
async function createPrismaClient(): Promise<PrismaClient> {
  const client = new PrismaClient({
    /* config */
  });

  // CRITICAL: Explicitly connect and verify
  await client.$connect();
  await client.$queryRaw`SELECT 1 as connection_test`;

  return client;
}

// Proxy with lazy initialization
export const prisma = new Proxy({} as PrismaClient, {
  get(target, prop) {
    return async (...args: any[]) => {
      const client = await getPrismaClient();
      const method = client[prop as keyof PrismaClient] as Function;
      return method.apply(client, args);
    };
  },
});
```

## Environment Configuration

- **DATABASE_URL**: Optimized for Supabase pooler with proper timeouts
- **Connection parameters**: pgBouncer-compatible settings
- **Regional consistency**: Ensuring pooler region matches deployment region

## Testing & Verification

Run the deployment script:

```bash
./scripts/fix-prisma-connection-issue.sh
```

Test endpoints:

```bash
# Database health check
curl https://destino-sf.vercel.app/api/health/database

# Previously failing endpoints
curl https://destino-sf.vercel.app/api/catering/lunch
curl https://destino-sf.vercel.app/api/spotlight-picks
```

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more "Engine is not yet connected" errors
- ✅ Proper connection initialization on cold starts
- ✅ Robust error recovery and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Consistent database connectivity in production
- ✅ Improved performance with optimized connection parameters

## Monitoring

Monitor Vercel function logs for:

- Connection initialization messages
- Retry attempt logs
- Any remaining connection errors

The fix addresses the serverless environment challenges while maintaining backward compatibility and improving overall database connection resilience.
