# Availability Management Redesign - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Complete redesign of the Availability Management system following the admin panel design system patterns used in Order Management.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **New Route Structure** (Separate Routes)

Previously everything was in tabs on one page. Now split into:

- `/admin/products/availability` - Main overview dashboard
- `/admin/products/availability/rules` - Rules management
- `/admin/products/availability/bulk` - Bulk editor
- `/admin/products/availability/timeline` - Timeline view

### 2. **New Reusable Components**

Created in `src/components/admin/availability/`:

- `AvailabilityStatusBadge.tsx` - Semantic colored status badges
- `AvailabilityStatCard.tsx` - Dashboard statistics cards
- `AvailabilityProductsTable.tsx` - Products table with bulk selection
- `AvailabilityFilters.tsx` - Filter component with active tags
- `AvailabilityTableSkeleton.tsx` - Loading skeletons

### 3. **New Types and Utilities**

- `src/types/availability-ui.ts` - UI-specific TypeScript interfaces
- `src/lib/availability-helpers.ts` - Color mapping and label functions

### 4. **Redesigned Pages**

#### Main Overview (`/admin/products/availability`)

- **FormHeader** with navigation breadcrumbs
- **Action buttons** to navigate to other sections
- **Statistics dashboard** with 4 colored stat cards
- **Quick Actions** section with icon buttons
- **Recent Activity** section (ready for audit log integration)
- **Products Overview** table with bulk actions

#### Rules Management (`/admin/products/availability/rules`)

- **AvailabilityFilters** component with active filter display
- **Rules table** with Order Management styling:
  - Bulk selection checkboxes
  - Status badges (enabled/disabled)
  - Priority badges with semantic colors
  - Action dropdown menus (Edit, Delete, Toggle)
- **Inline form** - When creating/editing, shows AvailabilityForm
- **Bulk actions toolbar** when rules selected

#### Bulk Editor (`/admin/products/availability/bulk`)

- **Product selection section** with:
  - Search and filter controls
  - Selectable products table
  - Selection summary
- **Rule configuration section** with:
  - Form inputs for rule details
  - Date pickers for date ranges
  - State-specific message fields
  - Preview panel showing what will be applied
- **Action buttons** with disabled states

#### Timeline View (`/admin/products/availability/timeline`)

- **Timeline filters** for date range and product selection
- **Event timeline** with:
  - Grouped by date
  - Visual timeline with dots and lines
  - Event cards showing rule activations/deactivations
  - "Today" badge for current date
- **Summary statistics** showing total events, starting rules, ending rules

## Design System Compliance

### Color Variants Used

Following FormSection variants:
