# Documentation Corrections Summary

## ⚠️ Critical Issue Discovered

After deep investigation of the actual Destino SF codebase, I discovered **major discrepancies** between the initially created documentation and the platform's actual capabilities. The original user guides included many features that **don't actually exist**.

## 🚫 Features Removed (Not Actually Implemented)

### Customer Features That Don't Exist
- ❌ **Birthday Field**: No birthday collection in Profile model
- ❌ **Address Management**: No saved addresses - entered fresh each order
- ❌ **Multiple Payment Methods**: Payment handled per-transaction via Square
- ❌ **Privacy/Notification Settings**: No email preference controls
- ❌ **Loyalty Program**: No points, rewards, or tier system
- ❌ **Advanced Customer Analytics**: No customer insights dashboard

### Admin Features That Don't Exist
- ❌ **Product Creation/Editing**: Products are readonly from Square POS
- ❌ **Advanced Business Analytics**: Limited to basic operational metrics
- ❌ **Inventory Management**: Handled entirely in Square POS
- ❌ **Customer Management Tools**: Limited customer data available
- ❌ **Advanced User Management**: Basic admin roles only

## ✅ Accurate Features Documented

### What Actually Works - Customer Side
- ✅ **Basic Profile Management**: Name, phone, email (email readonly)
- ✅ **Order History**: View past orders with status tracking
- ✅ **Order Tracking**: Real-time status updates via Square integration
- ✅ **Catering System**: Complete catering order workflow
- ✅ **Square Checkout**: Secure payment processing
- ✅ **Account Authentication**: Supabase-based login system

### What Actually Works - Admin Side

- ✅ **Square Product Sync**: Readonly products synced from Square POS
- ✅ **Catering Management**: Admin tools for catering orders
- ✅ **Basic Metrics**: Operational dashboards and order tracking
- ✅ **Square Integration**: Payment and order sync with Square POS

## 🔧 Architecture Reality Check

### Confirmed Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Payments**: Square Payment APIs (exclusive)
- **POS Integration**: Square POS (products, inventory, some orders)
- **Analytics**: Umami (web analytics only, not business intelligence)

### Square Integration Dependency
The platform is **heavily dependent on Square**:
- **All products** originate from Square catalog
- **All payments** processed through Square
- **Inventory management** handled in Square POS
- **Some order statuses** managed via Square webhooks
- **No product editing** available in the web platform
