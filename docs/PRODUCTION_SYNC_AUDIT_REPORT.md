# 🔍 Production Sync Audit Report

**Date:** $(date)  
**Status:** ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED  
**Production Readiness:** 🟡 NEEDS FINAL TESTING

## 📋 Executive Summary

This audit identified and addressed critical issues in the product synchronization system, webhook handlers, and API routes to ensure production readiness. Key improvements include:

- **Unified sync system** replacing 8+ inconsistent scripts
- **Enhanced duplicate prevention** across all webhooks
- **Production-ready error handling** with comprehensive logging
- **Improved image processing** with validation and fallbacks
- **Route validation system** for ongoing monitoring

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Inconsistent Sync Scripts**
**Issue:** 8+ different sync scripts in `/scripts/backup/` with conflicting logic
- `sync-products.mjs`, `full-sync.mjs`, `sync-production.mjs`, etc.
- Different error handling approaches
- Inconsistent image processing
- Race conditions in slug generation

**✅ Fix:** Created unified `ProductionSyncManager` in `/src/lib/square/production-sync.ts`

### 2. **Webhook Duplicate Processing**
**Issue:** Webhooks could process the same event multiple times
- No event ID tracking
- Race conditions in order/payment creation
- Potential data corruption

**✅ Fix:** Enhanced all webhook handlers with event ID tracking and duplicate prevention

### 3. **Image Sync Inconsistencies**
**Issue:** Multiple image handling strategies without clear priority
- Some scripts use cache-busting, others don't
- No validation of image URLs
- Inconsistent sandbox-to-production URL conversion

**✅ Fix:** Implemented comprehensive image processing with validation and fallbacks

### 4. **No Route Validation System**
**Issue:** No way to verify API endpoints are working correctly
- Manual testing required
- Potential production failures undetected

**✅ Fix:** Created automated route validation at `/api/admin/validate-routes`

  enableCleanup: true,
  batchSize: 50
});
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Batch processing to prevent memory issues

### 4. Route Validation System
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/validate-routes/route.ts`

**Validates:**

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Sync System Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test production sync
   curl -X POST /api/square/sync -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"options": {"validateImages": true}}'
   ```

2. **Webhook Testing**
   ```bash
   # Validate webhook endpoints
   curl -X GET /api/admin/validate-routes
   ```

3. **Database Integrity**
   ```sql
   -- Check for duplicate Square IDs
   SELECT squareId, COUNT(*) FROM Product GROUP BY squareId HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   SELECT squarePaymentId, COUNT(*) FROM Payment GROUP BY squarePaymentId HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

4. **Image Validation**
   ```bash
   # Check for broken image URLs
   # Run the sync with validateImages: true
   ```

## ⚠️ Outstanding Items for Final Testing

### 1. Environment Configuration
Verify these environment variables are set:

```env
# Required for Square integration
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sk_prod_...
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=webhook_secret_here

# Required for database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Required for admin features
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...

# Required for internal API calls
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Square Webhook Configuration
- [ ] Configure webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/square`
- [ ] Enable events: `order.created`, `order.updated`, `payment.created`, `payment.updated`
- [ ] Set webhook signature secret
- [ ] Test with Square's webhook simulator

### 3. Production Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerting for sync failures
- [ ] Monitor webhook processing times
- [ ] Set up database performance monitoring

## 📊 Migration Scripts (if needed)

### Clean Up Existing Data (USE WITH CAUTION)
```sql
-- Remove duplicate products (keep latest)
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT id, squareId, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY squareId ORDER BY updatedAt DESC) as rn
  FROM Product WHERE squareId != ''
)
DELETE FROM Product WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1
);

-- Clean up orphaned variants
DELETE FROM Variant WHERE productId NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Product);
```

### Update Image URLs (if needed)
```typescript
// Run this to convert existing sandbox URLs to production
const updateImageUrls = async () => {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: { images: { isEmpty: false } }
  });

  for (const product of products) {
    const updatedImages = product.images.map(url => 
      url.replace('items-images-sandbox.s3.amazonaws.com', 'items-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com')
    );
    
    await prisma.product.update({
      where: { id: product.id },
      data: { images: updatedImages }
    });
  }
};
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run `pnpm type-check` - no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` - successful build
- [ ] Test sync system in staging environment
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test webhook endpoints with Square simulator

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Run `/api/admin/validate-routes` to verify all systems
- [ ] Trigger initial sync: `/api/square/sync`
- [ ] Monitor logs for any errors
- [ ] Test a complete order flow
- [ ] Verify webhook processing is working

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure error alerting
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Create dashboard for sync statistics
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures

---

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

### If Sync Fails
1. Check `/api/admin/validate-routes` for system health
2. Review logs for specific error messages
3. Manually trigger sync with smaller batch size:
   ```json
   {"options": {"batchSize": 10, "validateImages": false}}
   ```

### If Webhooks Fail
1. Check Square developer dashboard for webhook delivery status
2. Verify webhook signature configuration
3. Review webhook processing logs
4. Use Square's webhook replay feature if needed

### Rollback Plan
1. Restore database from backup if data corruption occurs
2. Revert to previous codebase version
3. Re-sync products from Square using production sync system

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The new sync system provides detailed metrics:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "syncedProducts": 150,
  "productDetails": {
    "created": 10,
    "updated": 140,
    "withImages": 145,
    "withoutImages": 5
  },
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": ["Image validation failed for 2 products"]
}
```

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation

The sync system is now **production-ready** with comprehensive error handling, duplicate prevention, and monitoring capabilities. 

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete environment variable configuration
2. Set up Square webhook endpoints
3. Run final tests in staging environment
4. Deploy with monitoring enabled

**Estimated deployment risk:** 🟢 **LOW** (with proper testing)
