# Catering Database Issue Fix

## Problem

The catering page was throwing the following error when the database was empty or when catering models didn't exist:

```
Error fetching catering packages: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')
    at getCateringPackages (src/actions/catering.ts:26:46)
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. **Missing Database Models**: The catering functionality expected database models (`CateringPackage`, `CateringItem`, `CateringOrder`, etc.) that didn't exist in the Prisma schema.

2. **Database Connection Issues**: The `db` object was undefined in some cases, causing the `findMany()` method to fail.

3. **No Graceful Error Handling**: The code didn't handle the case when the database was empty or when tables didn't exist.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Catering Models to Prisma Schema

Added the following models to `prisma/schema.prisma`:

- `CateringPackage` - For catering package definitions
- `CateringItem` - For individual catering items
- `CateringPackageItem` - Junction table for package-item relationships
- `CateringRating` - For package ratings and reviews
- `CateringOrder` - For catering orders
- `CateringOrderItem` - For catering order line items
- `CateringItemOverrides` - For local overrides of Square items

### 2. Added Catering Enums

- `CateringStatus` - Order status tracking
- `CateringPackageType` - Package service styles
- `CateringItemCategory` - Item categorization

### 3. Updated Profile Model

Added `cateringOrders` relation to the `Profile` model to link customers with their catering orders.

### 4. Improved Error Handling

Updated the catering action functions to:

- Check if `db` is available before making queries
- Return empty arrays instead of throwing errors when tables don't exist
- Log warnings for debugging while gracefully degrading functionality
- Handle specific Prisma error codes (P2021, P1001)

### 5. Enhanced UI Feedback

- Added error message display on the catering page
- Added "No data available" message when database is empty
- Maintained page functionality even when catering data is unavailable

### 6. Created Sample Data Script

Created `src/scripts/init-catering-data.ts` to initialize sample catering data for testing.

## Database Migrations Applied

1. **20250617223751_add_catering_models** - Added all catering models
2. **20250617223903_add_square_checkout_url_to_catering_order** - Added checkout URL field

## How to Use

### For Development

1. **Run migrations** (already applied):
   ```bash
   pnpm prisma migrate dev
   ```

2. **Initialize sample data** (optional):
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx src/scripts/init-catering-data.ts
   ```

### For Production

The migrations will be applied automatically during deployment. The catering page will gracefully handle empty databases by showing appropriate messages.

## Key Benefits

- **No More Crashes**: The catering page no longer crashes when the database is empty
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shows helpful messages instead of errors
- **Future-Proof**: Database schema supports full catering functionality
- **Better UX**: Users see informative messages instead of technical errors

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
- The catering page loads without errors even with an empty database
- Appropriate messages are shown when no catering data is available
- The page maintains its layout and functionality
- Sample data can be easily added for testing

## Next Steps

1. **Add Catering Data**: Use the admin panel or scripts to add actual catering packages and items
2. **Configure Square Integration**: Set up Square product syncing for catering items
3. **Test Order Flow**: Verify the complete catering order process works end-to-end
