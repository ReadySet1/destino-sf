# Order Cleanup Operations

This document describes how to safely clean testing orders from your database using the automated cleanup scripts.

## Overview

The order cleanup system provides a safe, controlled way to remove testing orders while preserving all legitimate customer data. It includes comprehensive safety features and backup/restore capabilities.

## Scripts

### 1. Safe Cleanup Workflow (`safe-cleanup-workflow.ts`) ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

A master workflow script that orchestrates the complete safety process:

- Full database backup before any changes
- Order-specific backup for granular restore
- Testing order cleanup with all safety features
- Verification and rollback capabilities

### 2. Database Backup & Restore (`backup-database.ts`, `restore-database.ts`)

Full PostgreSQL database backup and restore scripts using pg_dump:

- Multiple formats (custom, SQL, directory)
- Compression and verification
- Metadata tracking and retention management

### 3. Clean Testing Orders (`clean-testing-orders.ts`)

The main cleanup script that identifies and removes testing orders based on configurable criteria.

### 4. Restore Orders from Backup (`restore-orders-from-backup.ts`)

A companion script to restore orders from backup files if needed.

## Quick Start

### **üõ°Ô∏è RECOMMENDED: Safe Cleanup Workflow (Maximum Safety)**

The safest way to clean testing orders with full database backup:

```bash
# 1. Preview the complete workflow (always do this first!)
pnpm safe-cleanup:preview

# 2. Execute safe cleanup of test emails only (safest option)
pnpm safe-cleanup:test-emails

# 3. Execute full safe cleanup with all protections
pnpm safe-cleanup:execute
```

### **‚ö° Alternative: Direct Order Cleanup**

For experienced users who want more control:

```bash
# Preview deletion with default criteria
pnpm clean-orders:preview

# Clean orders with confirmation and backup
pnpm clean-orders:execute

# Clean only test email orders
pnpm clean-orders:test-emails
```

### **üíæ Database Backup (Standalone)**

Create full database backups independently:

```bash
# Create compressed custom format backup (recommended)
pnpm backup-db

# Create SQL backup for analysis
pnpm backup-db:sql

# Schema-only backup
pnpm backup-db:schema
```

## Safety Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Multiple Safety Layers

**Safe Cleanup Workflow (Recommended):**

1. **Full Database Backup**: Complete PostgreSQL dump before any changes
2. **Order Analysis**: Preview exactly what will be cleaned
3. **Order-Specific Backup**: JSON backup of orders to be deleted
4. **Transaction Safety**: All changes in database transactions with rollback
5. **Step-by-Step Confirmation**: Interactive approval for each major step
6. **Automatic Verification**: Backup integrity and result validation

**Individual Scripts:**

1. **Dry Run Mode (Default)**: Preview changes before execution
2. **Automatic Backup**: Creates JSON backup before deletion
3. **Transaction Rollback**: All changes roll back on error
4. **Confirmation Prompts**: Interactive confirmation for production
5. **Exclusion Lists**: Hardcoded protection for known production orders
6. **Referential Integrity**: Proper deletion order to maintain database consistency

### üíæ Database Backup Features

- **Multiple Formats**: Custom (recommended), SQL, or Directory formats
- **Compression**: Automatic compression to save space
- **Verification**: Backup integrity checking
- **Metadata Tracking**: Complete backup information and recovery instructions
- **Retention Management**: Automatic cleanup of old backups
- **Performance**: Parallel processing for large databases

### üîç Order Identification

The script identifies testing orders using multiple criteria:

- **Test Email Patterns**: `test@`, `demo@`, `example@`, `+test`, `.test`, etc.
- **Failed Orders**: Orders with `FAILED` payment status
- **Cancelled Orders**: Orders with `CANCELLED` status
- **Old Orders**: Failed/cancelled orders older than 90 days (optional)
- **Date Ranges**: Orders within specific date ranges
- **Custom Exclusions**: Specific order IDs to always preserve

### üéØ What Gets Preserved

The script will **NEVER** delete:

- Orders with production customer emails
- High-value paid orders (>$100 with PAID status)
- Orders in the hardcoded exclusion list
- Orders outside specified date ranges

```

## Workflow

### Recommended Cleanup Process

1. **Preview First** (Always!)

   ```bash
   pnpm clean-orders:preview
   ```

2. **Review the Report**
   - Check the number of orders to be deleted
   - Review sample orders and deletion reasons
   - Verify no legitimate orders are included

3. **Start with Conservative Options**

   ```bash
   # Start with test emails only
   pnpm clean-orders:test-emails

   # Then clean specific date ranges if needed
   pnpm tsx src/scripts/clean-testing-orders.ts --execute --from="2024-01-01" --to="2024-01-31"
   ```

4. **Verify Results**
   - Check application functionality
   - Verify database integrity
   - Monitor for any issues

5. **Keep Backup Files**
   - Store backup files safely
   - Document what was cleaned
   - Keep backups for at least 30 days

### Emergency Restore Process

If you need to restore deleted orders:

1. **Locate Backup File**

   ```bash
   ls -la backups/order-cleanup/
   ```

2. **Preview Restoration**

   ```bash
   pnpm restore-orders --backup-file="path/to/backup.json" --dry-run
   ```

3. **Execute Restoration**
   ```bash
   pnpm restore-orders --backup-file="path/to/backup.json" --execute
   ```

## Database Impact

### Tables Affected

The cleanup process affects these tables in order:

1. **email_alerts** (references orders)
2. **order_items** (references orders, products, variants)
3. **catering_order_items** (references catering_orders)
4. **refunds** (references payments)
5. **payments** (references orders)
6. **catering_orders** (main table)
7. **orders** (main table)

### Referential Integrity

The script maintains database integrity by:

- Deleting in correct dependency order
- Using database transactions
- Checking foreign key constraints
- Rolling back on any error

## Monitoring and Logs

### Script Output

The scripts provide detailed logging:

- Configuration summary
- Orders found and criteria
- Deletion progress
- Error messages
- Final report with statistics

### Backup Files

Backup files contain:

- All deleted order data
- Related data (payments, items, etc.)
- Metadata (timestamp, configuration)
- Restore instructions

### Report Example

## Best Practices

### üéØ Before Running

1. **Test in Development First**
   - Run scripts on development/staging database
   - Verify behavior matches expectations
   - Test restore process

2. **Review Current Data**
   - Check total order counts
   - Identify legitimate vs. test orders
   - Note any special cases

3. **Plan Cleanup Strategy**
   - Start with conservative criteria
   - Clean in phases if needed
   - Schedule during low-traffic periods

### üí° During Cleanup

1. **Always Preview First**
   - Never skip the dry-run step
   - Review all output carefully
   - Understand what will be deleted

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch for errors or warnings
   - Note performance on large datasets
   - Keep logs for documentation

### üîí After Cleanup

1. **Verify Application**
   - Test key user flows
   - Check admin interfaces
   - Verify reporting systems

2. **Database Integrity**
   - Run basic queries
   - Check foreign key constraints
   - Monitor for orphaned records

3. **Document Results**
   - Save cleanup reports
   - Note any issues found
   - Update cleanup procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No orders found matching criteria"**

- Review your criteria settings
- Check date ranges
- Verify test email patterns

**"Transaction failed and rolled back"**

- Database constraint violation
- Check foreign key relationships
- Review error messages for details

**"Backup file not found"**

- Verify backup file path
- Check backup directory permissions
- Ensure backup was created successfully

### Error Recovery

If cleanup fails:

1. **Check Error Messages**: Review detailed error output
2. **Database State**: Database should be unchanged due to transaction rollback
3. **Retry Strategy**: Fix issues and retry with smaller batch sizes
4. **Manual Cleanup**: Use database tools for complex cases

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Logs**: Review script output and error messages
2. **Database Status**: Verify database connectivity and health
3. **Backup Status**: Ensure backups are available
4. **Contact Support**: Provide error logs and configuration details

## Security Considerations

### Production Safety

- Scripts include extra confirmation for production environments
- Hardcoded exclusion lists protect critical orders
- Transaction rollback prevents partial deletions
- Automatic backups enable recovery

### Data Privacy

- Backup files contain sensitive customer data
- Store backups securely
- Delete old backups according to retention policies
- Encrypt backups if required by compliance

### Access Control

- Limit script access to authorized personnel
- Use proper database credentials
- Log script execution for audit trails
- Follow principle of least privilege
