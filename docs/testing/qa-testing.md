## 📊 Implementation Strategy - Synchronized with Production Deployment

### Week-by-Week Execution Plan (Aligned with Production Roadmap)

#### Week 1: Critical Testing + Webhook Validation Support

**Supports Production Task #3: Webhook Signature Validation**

1. **Fix failing test**: `order-creation-enhanced.test.ts` (URGENT)
2. **Test existing systems**: Rate limiting and security headers (validate ✅ completed tasks)
3. **Prepare for Task #3**: Create webhook validation test framework

```bash
# Daily execution - verify production-ready systems
pnpm test:payments
pnpm test:critical
pnpm test:coverage:critical

# New: Test production infrastructure
pnpm test:rate-limiting
pnpm test:security-headers
```

#### Week 2: Complete Critical Testing + Enable Task #3

## 🛠️ Tools & Best Practices

### TypeScript Testing Patterns

```typescript
// Example: Payment API Test
interface PaymentTestCase {
  description: string;
  input: PaymentRequest;
  expected: PaymentResponse;
  shouldThrow?: boolean;
}

describe('PaymentAPI', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  it('should process valid payment', async () => {
    // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
  });
});
```

### Coverage Monitoring

```bash
# Real-time coverage tracking
pnpm test:coverage

# Critical path only
pnpm test:coverage:critical

# Component-specific
pnpm test:components
```

### Mock Strategy

```typescript
// Mock external services
jest.mock('@/lib/square/client', () => ({
  squareClient: {
    paymentsApi: mockPaymentsApi,
    ordersApi: mockOrdersApi,
  },
}));
```

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Daily Practices

1. **Run critical tests**: `pnpm test:critical` before each deployment
2. **Monitor coverage**: Check coverage report daily
3. **Fix failing tests**: Immediate priority for any test failures

### Weekly Reviews

1. **Coverage analysis**: Review progress against targets
2. **Risk assessment**: Identify new untested critical paths
3. **Test enhancement**: Improve existing test quality

### Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Critical Tests
  run: pnpm test:ci:critical

- name: Coverage Check
  run: pnpm test:coverage

- name: Fail on Low Coverage
  run: |
    if coverage < 80%; then
      exit 1
    fi
```

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. Fix the failing `order-creation-enhanced.test.ts`
2. Add basic webhook validation tests
3. Implement payment error scenario tests

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Priority

- **Square payment processing**: Direct financial impact
- **Webhook handlers**: Silent data corruption risk
- **Admin order management**: Business operation risk
- **Authentication flows**: Security risk

### Monitoring & Alerts

- Set up coverage monitoring in CI/CD
- Create alerts for test failures
- Regular security test reviews

This plan provides a structured approach to systematically improve your test coverage while prioritizing business-critical functionality. Start with Phase 1 immediately to address the most critical risks.
