# Development to Main Merge Plan

## üîç **Current Status Summary (Oct 2, 2025)**

**Database Gap Identified:**

- ‚úÖ Production: 31 migrations (latest: `enable_rls_availability_tables`)
- ‚úÖ Development: 57 migrations (latest: `populate_shipping_configurations`)
- üî¥ **Gap: 26 migrations need to be applied to production**

**Key Findings:**

- `shipping_configurations` table exists in BOTH prod and dev (empty in both)
- Latest migration is a safe data-only insert (3 shipping configs)
- Product type badges tables exist only in development
- Some Prisma CLI commands timeout (use Supabase MCP instead)

**Merge Complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH (due to migration gap)

---

## Claude Code Prompt

````
I need to safely merge the development branch into main for production deployment. This is a critical operation that requires careful attention to database migrations and production safety.

## Project Context
- **Repository**: ReadySet1/destino-sf
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Supabase
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Current Branch**: develop (several commits ahead of main)
- **Target Branch**: main (production)

## Pre-Merge Checklist

### 1. Database Backup from Development and PRODUCTION (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)
Create a manual backup of the production database before ANY changes:

```bash
# Create timestamped backup directory
mkdir -p backups/pre-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Option A: Using the project's backup script
pnpm backup-db:sql

# Option B: Direct pg_dump (if you have direct DB access)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backups/pre-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/production-backup.sql

# Also backup the schema separately for quick reference
pnpm backup-db:schema
````

**Verification**: Confirm backup file exists and has reasonable size (> 100KB)

### 2. Environment Validation

Verify all environment variables are properly set:

```bash
# Check database connection
pnpm diagnose-db

# Validate database configuration
pnpm validate-db

# Verify Square API tokens (if applicable)
pnpm test-square-tokens
```

### 3. Dependency Check

Ensure all dependencies are in sync:

```bash
# Install/update dependencies
pnpm install

# Verify lockfile is committed
git status pnpm-lock.yaml
```

### 4. Local Testing Suite

Run comprehensive tests before merge:

```bash
# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Critical path tests
pnpm test:critical

# Unit tests
pnpm test:unit

# Component tests
pnpm test:components

# Integration tests (if available)
pnpm test:integration
```

### 5. Migration Analysis

Review and understand all pending migrations:

```bash
# List all migrations
ls -la prisma/migrations/

# Check for migrations that haven't been applied to production
# Compare with main branch migrations
git diff main..develop -- prisma/migrations/

# Review migration files for:
# - Data modifications
# - Schema changes
# - Potential breaking changes
# - Rollback complexity
```

**CURRENT DATABASE DIFFERENCES (as of Oct 2, 2025):**

#### ‚úÖ Already in Production (Sept 30, 2025):

- `availability_rules` table (19 columns, 4 indexes, RLS policies)
- `availability_schedule` table (7 columns, 2 indexes, RLS policies)

#### üî¥ CRITICAL: 26 Migrations Missing in Production

**Development is significantly ahead of production. Here are the key missing migrations:**

**Latest Missing Migrations (Most Critical):**

1. **`20251002061347_populate_shipping_configurations`** (Oct 2, 2025)
   - **Type:** Data migration
   - **Risk:** LOW
   - **Action:** Inserts 3 shipping weight configurations
   - **Rollback:** `DELETE FROM shipping_configurations;`

2. **`20251002050424_add_badge3_and_icon_fields`** (Oct 2, 2025)
   - **Type:** Schema change
   - **Risk:** MEDIUM
   - **Action:** Adds badge and icon fields to product types

3. **`20251002042810_add_badge_colors_to_product_type_badges`** (Oct 2, 2025)
   - **Type:** Schema change
   - **Risk:** MEDIUM
   - **Action:** Adds color fields to badge configuration

4. **`20251002040944_add_product_type_and_badges_table`** (Oct 2, 2025)
   - **Type:** Schema change
   - **Risk:** HIGH
   - **Action:** Creates new product_type_badges table

**Earlier Missing Migrations:** 23 additional migrations from Sept 12 - Sept 30

- Various performance, RLS, and schema fixes
- See development migration list for complete details

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** All 26 migrations must be applied to production in order!

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Schema Inconsistencies:

1. **Products Table:**
   - `description_validated_at`: Production uses `timestamp with time zone`, Dev uses `timestamp without time zone`
   - **Action Required:** Verify this doesn't cause issues

2. **Store Settings:**
   - Production MAY have `usage_flags` (jsonb) column
   - **Action Required:** Verify if this column exists and is needed

**Migration Summary Document:**
| Migration | Date | Type | Risk | Rollback Strategy |
|-----------|------|------|------|-------------------|
| populate_shipping_configurations | 2025-10-02 | Data | LOW | `DELETE FROM shipping_configurations;` |

### 6. Build Verification

Ensure the application builds successfully:

```bash
# Full type-check and build
pnpm typecheck-build

# If successful, clean build artifacts
rm -rf .next
```

## Merge Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Branch Synchronization

```bash
# Ensure develop is up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# Check for conflicts before merging
git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main

# If conflicts exist:
# 1. Resolve carefully, prioritizing production stability
# 2. Test after each conflict resolution
# 3. Document significant conflict resolutions

# If no conflicts or after resolution:
git merge --abort  # We'll do the actual merge later
```

### Phase 2: Pre-Production Testing

```bash
# Create a temporary merge branch for testing
git checkout -b temp/merge-test
git merge origin/main

# Run full test suite on merged code
pnpm test:ci

# Run E2E critical tests
pnpm test:e2e:critical

# If tests fail:
# - Fix issues on develop branch
# - Delete temp branch: git branch -D temp/merge-test
# - Start over from Phase 1

# Delete temp branch after verification
git checkout develop
git branch -D temp/merge-test
```

### Phase 3: Database Migration Dry Run

**SPECIFIC MIGRATIONS TO REVIEW:**

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with latest schema
pnpm prisma generate

# View migration status (DON'T APPLY YET)
pnpm prisma migrate status

# Review the specific pending migration
cat prisma/migrations/20251002000000_populate_shipping_configurations/migration.sql

# Expected migration content:
# - DELETE FROM shipping_configurations (clears existing)
# - INSERT 3 default configurations:
#   1. alfajores (0.5 lb base, 0.4 lb/unit)
#   2. empanadas (1.0 lb base, 0.8 lb/unit)
#   3. default (0.5 lb base, 0.5 lb/unit)
# - Verification logic to ensure 3 configs inserted

# Verify production has shipping_configurations table
# If NOT, this migration will FAIL - need to create table first
```

**‚úÖ VERIFIED DATABASE STATUS (via Supabase MCP - Oct 2, 2025):**

**Development Database (drrejylrcjbeldnzodjd):**

- Total Migrations: 57
- Latest: `20251002061347_populate_shipping_configurations`
- shipping_configurations table: ‚úÖ EXISTS (0 rows - needs population)

**Production Database (ocusztulyiegeawqptrs):**

- Total Migrations: 31
- Latest: `20250930093511_enable_rls_availability_tables`
- shipping_configurations table: ‚úÖ EXISTS (0 rows)
- **Gap: 26 migrations behind development**

**Migration Analysis:**

- The table ALREADY EXISTS in production (created in earlier migration)
- The `populate_shipping_configurations` migration will safely insert 3 default rows
- Safe to apply - it's a data-only migration with built-in verification

**Why `pnpm prisma migrate status` hangs:**
Use Supabase MCP instead for faster status checks:

```bash
# Alternative: Use Supabase CLI or MCP tools for migration status
# The Prisma CLI can timeout with pooler connections
```

### Phase 4: The Actual Merge

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge develop into main
git merge develop --no-ff -m "Merge develop into main for production deployment

Includes:
- [List major features/fixes]
- Database migrations: [List migration names]
- Dependencies updated: [Note major dep changes]

Pre-merge checklist completed:
‚úÖ Database backup created
‚úÖ All tests passing
‚úÖ Build successful
‚úÖ Migration plan reviewed
"

# If merge is successful, DON'T PUSH YET
```

### Phase 5: Production Database Migration

‚ö†Ô∏è **POINT OF NO RETURN - After this, rollback requires using backup** ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
# Apply migrations to production database
pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# Verify migration success
pnpm prisma migrate status

# Test critical database queries
pnpm diagnose-db

# If migration fails:
# 1. DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN
# 2. Restore from backup:
#    pnpm restore-db
# 3. Review migration errors
# 4. Fix on develop branch and restart
```

### Phase 6: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Push to main (triggers Vercel deployment)
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment in Vercel dashboard
# Watch for build errors or deployment failures

# If deployment fails:
# 1. Quickly revert the merge commit:
#    git revert HEAD
#    git push origin main
# 2. Restore database from backup if needed
# 3. Debug issues on develop
```

### Phase 7: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run smoke tests against production
pnpm test:e2e:smoke-production

# Monitor application logs for errors
# Check Sentry for new errors

# Verify critical user paths:
# - Authentication
# - Checkout flow
# - Admin functions
# - API endpoints

# Monitor for 10-15 minutes after deployment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Prisma Commands Timing Out

If `pnpm prisma migrate status` or other Prisma commands hang:

**Root Cause:** Pooler connection timeouts with long-running introspection queries.

**Solution 1: Use Supabase MCP (Fastest)**
The Supabase MCP tools are already configured and faster:

- Lists migrations without timeout issues
- Direct database queries work reliably
- Used in this plan for verification

**Solution 2: Use Direct Connection**

```bash
# Temporarily use DIRECT_DATABASE_URL for Prisma commands
export DIRECT_URL=$DIRECT_DATABASE_URL
pnpm prisma migrate status --schema prisma/schema.prisma
```

**Solution 3: Increase Timeout**

```bash
# Set longer timeout for Prisma (not recommended)
export PRISMA_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=60000
pnpm prisma migrate status
```

**Solution 4: Check via SQL**

```sql
-- Query migration status directly
SELECT version, name FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback (< 30 minutes after deploy)

```bash
# 1. Revert the merge commit on main
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# 2. This triggers a new deployment with previous code

# 3. Assess database state
# - If new migrations ran, may need to restore backup
# - Check if rollback scripts exist in prisma/rollback_scripts/
```

### Database Rollback

```bash
# If database changes need to be reverted:

# 1. Stop application (set maintenance mode in Vercel if possible)

# 2. Restore from backup
pnpm restore-db

# OR manually:
psql $DATABASE_URL < backups/pre-merge-[timestamp]/production-backup.sql

# 3. Verify data integrity
pnpm diagnose-db

# 4. Resume application
```

## Post-Merge Cleanup

After successful deployment and verification:

```bash
# Update develop branch with any hotfixes made to main
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Tag the release
git checkout main
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Production release [date]"
git push origin v1.x.x

# Clean up local branches
git branch -d temp/merge-test  # if still exists

# Document the deployment in team channels
# Update any deployment logs or wikis
```

## Monitoring Checklist (First 24 Hours)

- [ ] Error rates in Sentry
- [ ] Database performance metrics
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] User-reported issues
- [ ] Payment processing (if applicable)
- [ ] Email delivery

## Notes & Observations

[Space for Claude Code to document findings during execution]

---

**Remember**: When in doubt, DO NOT proceed. It's better to delay deployment than to corrupt production data or cause extended downtime.

Good luck! üöÄ

```

## Timeline Estimate

- **Pre-merge checks**: 30-45 minutes
- **Merge execution**: 15-20 minutes
- **Database migration**: 5-10 minutes
- **Deployment**: 10-15 minutes
- **Verification**: 15-30 minutes
- **Total**: ~2 hours (allow 3 hours with buffer)

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All tests passing on merged code
‚úÖ Database backup created and verified
‚úÖ Migrations applied successfully
‚úÖ Application deployed without errors
‚úÖ Critical user paths functioning
‚úÖ No increase in error rates
‚úÖ Database performance stable
```
