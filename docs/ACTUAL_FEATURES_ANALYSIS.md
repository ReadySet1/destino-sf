## 🎯 What This Means for Documentation

The user guides I created included many features that **don't actually exist**. I need to:

1. **Remove Non-Existent Features**:
   - Address management
   - Multiple payment methods
   - Privacy/notification settings
   - Loyalty program
   - Birthday field
   - Advanced analytics

2. **Focus on Actual Features**:
   - Basic profile management (name, phone)
   - Order placement and tracking
   - Catering system
   - Square-integrated payments
   - Simple order history

3. **Correct Admin Documentation**:
   - Emphasize Square integration
   - Remove product creation/editing capabilities
   - Focus on order management workflow
   - Clarify limitations of analytics

4. **Update Architecture Information**:
   - Clearly explain Square dependency
   - Document readonly nature of products
   - Explain order sync workflow

This analysis shows the platform is more **streamlined and Square-centric** than I initially documented. The guides need to reflect this simpler, more focused feature set.
