# Catering Orders Account Integration Fix

## Problem Identified

Users were unable to see their catering orders in their account page (`/account`). The issue was that the application had two separate order systems:

1. **Regular Orders** - stored in the `Order` table with `userId` field
2. **Catering Orders** - stored in the `CateringOrder` table with `customerId` field

The account page's `OrderHistory` component was only fetching regular orders from the `Order` table, completely ignoring catering orders.

## Root Cause

The API endpoint `/api/user/orders` was only querying the `Order` table:

```typescript
// OLD CODE - Only regular orders
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: { userId: user.id },
  // ... rest of query
});
```

This meant catering orders (stored in `CateringOrder` table with `customerId` field) were never retrieved.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated API Route (`/api/user/orders/route.ts`)

- **Enhanced Type Definitions**: Added separate types for regular and catering orders
- **Unified Interface**: Created a `UserOrder` interface that works for both order types
- **Dual Query System**: Now fetches from both `Order` and `CateringOrder` tables
- **Data Transformation**: Converts both order types to a unified format
- **Proper Sorting**: Combines and sorts orders by creation date

Key improvements:
```typescript
// Fetch regular orders
const regularOrders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: { userId: user.id },
  // ...
});

// Fetch catering orders
const cateringOrders = await prisma.cateringOrder.findMany({
  where: { customerId: user.id },
  // ...
});

// Combine and sort
const allOrders = [...unifiedRegularOrders, ...unifiedCateringOrders].sort(
  (a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime()
);
```

### 2. Enhanced OrderHistory Component (`/components/Store/OrderHistory.tsx`)

- **Visual Differentiation**: Added order type badges (REGULAR vs CATERING)
- **Catering-Specific Fields**: Added event date and number of people display
- **Dynamic Columns**: Shows appropriate columns based on order types present
- **Enhanced Status Mapping**: Added catering-specific statuses (CONFIRMED, PREPARING)

Visual improvements:
- ðŸ”µ Blue badge for regular orders
- ðŸŸ¡ Amber badge for catering orders
- ðŸ“… Calendar icon for event dates
- ðŸ‘¥ Users icon for number of people

### 3. Updated Order Details Page (`/account/order/[orderId]/page.tsx`)

- **Dual Order Lookup**: Checks both `Order` and `CateringOrder` tables
- **Type-Specific Display**: Shows relevant fields for each order type
- **Catering Information**: Displays event date, number of people, delivery address, special requests
- **Proper Item Display**: Handles different item structures for regular vs catering orders

## Database Schema Integration

The fix properly handles the existing database structure:

### Regular Orders
- Table: `Order`
- User Link: `userId` field
- Items: `OrderItem` with product/variant references

### Catering Orders  
- Table: `CateringOrder`
- User Link: `customerId` field (links to `Profile.id`)
- Items: `CateringOrderItem` with name and type fields

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Test Catering Order**: Ensure a catering order exists for the test user
2. **Verify Account Display**: Check that both regular and catering orders appear
3. **Test Order Details**: Verify order detail pages work for both types
4. **Check Visual Indicators**: Confirm badges and icons display correctly

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/user/orders/route.ts` - API endpoint for fetching orders
2. `src/components/Store/OrderHistory.tsx` - Order history display component  
3. `src/app/(store)/account/order/[orderId]/page.tsx` - Order details page

## Benefits

- âœ… Users can now see ALL their orders (regular + catering) in one place
- âœ… Clear visual distinction between order types
- âœ… Appropriate information displayed for each order type
- âœ… Unified user experience across order management
- âœ… Backward compatible with existing regular orders
- âœ… Proper TypeScript typing and error handling

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding filters to show only regular or catering orders
- Add order type icons in addition to badges
- Implement catering-specific actions (modify guest count, etc.)
- Add catering order status timeline display
