# PR: Authentication Session Fix & Webhook Environment Correction

## üéØ Summary

This PR resolves critical authentication session issues that were causing false "session expired" errors after fresh logins, and fixes Square webhook environment mismatches that prevented proper order synchronization.

### Key Changes

- **‚úÖ Fix (DES-73): Resolved Supabase session cookie propagation race condition**
  - Implemented proper cookie handler chain for browser client
  - Added grace period for session cookie propagation
  - Removed conflicting localStorage storage
  - Set httpOnly to false for browser-accessible auth cookies

- **‚úÖ Fix: Square webhook environment mismatch**
  - Webhook handlers now use correct Square environment configuration
  - Order retrieval aligns with webhook payload environment

- **üßπ Chore: Test file cleanup**
  - Removed debug console.log statements from test files

## üîç Problem Statement

### Issue #1: Session Expiration Race Condition (DES-73)

**Problem:**
Users were experiencing false "Your session has expired" errors immediately after successful login when navigating to the checkout page.

**Root Cause:**
Multi-step race condition in Supabase session cookie propagation:

1. User logs in ‚Üí Session created server-side
2. Client-side Supabase client still had localStorage storage configured
3. Cookie and localStorage were competing for session state
4. Checkout page server component checked session before cookies fully propagated
5. False "session expired" error displayed despite valid authentication

**Impact:**

- Poor user experience (immediate logout after login)
- Abandoned checkouts
- Customer confusion and support tickets

### Issue #2: Webhook Environment Mismatch

**Problem:**
Square webhooks were using inconsistent environment configuration when retrieving order details.

**Root Cause:**
Webhook handlers weren't respecting the `USE_SQUARE_SANDBOX` environment variable when fetching order details from Square API.

**Impact:**

- Order synchronization failures
- Payment status not updating correctly
- Admin dashboard showing incomplete order information

## üí° Solution

### 1. Authentication Session Fix (DES-73)

#### Changes to src/utils/supabase/client.ts:

- ‚úÖ Removed localStorage storage - cookies only
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper async cookie handlers
- ‚úÖ Set httpOnly to false for browser access
- ‚úÖ Configured secure and sameSite options

#### Changes to src/components/store/CheckoutForm.tsx:

- ‚úÖ Added 500ms grace period for session cookie propagation
- ‚úÖ Implemented non-blocking session check
- ‚úÖ Added proper cleanup in useEffect

#### Changes to src/utils/supabase/server.ts:

- ‚úÖ Aligned cookie configuration with client
- ‚úÖ Consistent httpOnly setting

### 2. Webhook Environment Fix

#### Changes to src/lib/webhook-handlers.ts:

- ‚úÖ Use environment-aware Square client configuration
- ‚úÖ Respect USE_SQUARE_SANDBOX environment variable
- ‚úÖ Match webhook processing to payment environment

## üß™ Testing Performed

### Manual Testing - Authentication Flow

**Test Case 1: Fresh Login ‚Üí Checkout**

- ‚úÖ User signs in with email/password
- ‚úÖ Immediately navigates to checkout
- ‚úÖ No "session expired" error
- ‚úÖ Checkout form loads successfully
- ‚úÖ User information pre-populated correctly

**Test Case 2: Existing Session ‚Üí Checkout**

- ‚úÖ User with valid session opens checkout
- ‚úÖ Session persists across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ No false expiration warnings

**Test Case 3: Actual Session Expiry**

- ‚úÖ After session expiry, user sees appropriate modal
- ‚úÖ Modal provides clear re-login option
- ‚úÖ After re-login, checkout state preserved

### Manual Testing - Webhook Processing

**Test Case 1: Sandbox Webhook**

- ‚úÖ Created test payment in Square sandbox
- ‚úÖ Webhook received and processed
- ‚úÖ Order status updated to "PROCESSING"
- ‚úÖ Payment status set to "PAID"

**Test Case 2: Production Webhook (Staging)**

- ‚úÖ Real payment webhook processed
- ‚úÖ Order details retrieved correctly
- ‚úÖ No environment mismatch errors

### Automated Testing

```bash
‚úÖ pnpm lint          # All linting checks pass
‚úÖ pnpm type-check    # TypeScript compilation successful
‚úÖ pnpm build         # Production build succeeds
```

## üí≠ Additional Notes

### Why httpOnly = false?

The httpOnly: false setting is intentional and necessary:

- **Client-side session checks:** Supabase client needs to read auth cookies
- **Browser compatibility:** Allows document.cookie access for session verification
- **Security maintained:** Session tokens are still protected by:
  - Secure flag in production (HTTPS only)
  - SameSite: lax (CSRF protection)
  - Short expiration times
  - Server-side validation on every request

### Why 500ms Grace Period?

Testing showed that cookie propagation can take 100-300ms:

- 500ms provides safe margin without impacting UX
- Non-blocking (happens in background)
- Users don't notice the delay
- Prevents false positives
