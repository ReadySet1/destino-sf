# Test Infrastructure Fix Implementation Guide

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Jest Configuration

- ✅ **Multi-environment setup**: Separate Node.js and jsdom environments
- ✅ **Project-based configuration**: Different configs for different test types
- ✅ **Enhanced test scripts**: Targeted scripts for each environment

### 2. Environment Setup

- ✅ **Node.js setup**: `/src/__tests__/setup/node-setup.js`
- ✅ **jsdom setup**: `/src/__tests__/setup/jsdom-setup.js`
- ✅ **Database mocks**: Comprehensive Prisma mocking strategy

### 3. Package Scripts

- ✅ **Environment-specific scripts**: `test:node`, `test:jsdom`
- ✅ **Targeted testing**: Individual scripts for components, units, API routes
- ✅ **Watch mode support**: Separate watch scripts for different environments

## 🔄 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Day 1-2)

### Step 1: Test the New Configuration

```bash
# Test the basic setup
pnpm test:basic

# Test Node.js environment (business logic)
pnpm test:node

# Test jsdom environment (React components)
pnpm test:jsdom

# Test specific modules
pnpm test:shipping
pnpm test:delivery
pnpm test:cart-summary
```

### Step 2: Fix Remaining Mock Issues

Based on test results, address these potential issues:

#### A. Update Prisma Import Mocks

If shipping/delivery tests still fail, update the mock in `node-setup.js`:

```javascript
// More specific Prisma mock
jest.mock('@/lib/db', () => ({
  prisma: {
    // Mock implementation from database-mocks.ts
  },
}));
```

#### B. Component Import Fixes

If component tests fail due to missing components, check import paths in:

- `src/__tests__/components/cart/CartSummary.test.tsx`

#### C. Missing Component Mock

If `CartSummary` component doesn't exist, create a minimal mock:

```typescript
// src/components/Store/CartSummary.tsx
export interface CartSummaryProps {
  subtotal: number;
  totalItems: number;
  cartType?: 'regular' | 'catering';
}

export const CartSummary: React.FC<CartSummaryProps> = ({
  subtotal,
  totalItems,
  cartType = 'regular',
}) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

## 🛠️ TESTING COMMANDS REFERENCE

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start with basic validation
pnpm test:basic

# Test business logic (shipping, delivery, etc.)
pnpm test:unit

# Test React components
pnpm test:components

# Test API routes
pnpm test:api

# Full test suite
pnpm test

# Coverage analysis
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Debug Specific Issues

```bash
# Debug shipping calculations
pnpm test:shipping

# Debug delivery zone logic
pnpm test:delivery

# Debug React component rendering
pnpm test:cart-summary

# Watch mode for active development
pnpm test:unit:watch
pnpm test:components:watch
```

### CI/CD Commands

```bash
# Production-ready test runs
pnpm test:ci
pnpm test:ci:unit
pnpm test:ci:components
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@/components/...'"

**Solution**: Check component exists or update import path in test

### Issue: "ReferenceError: document is not defined"

**Solution**: Ensure test is running in jsdom environment:

```bash
pnpm test:jsdom src/__tests__/components/path/to/test.tsx
```

### Issue: "Prisma client is not available"

**Solution**: Check mock setup in `node-setup.js` and ensure proper import

### Issue: "TextEncoder is not defined"

**Solution**: Already fixed in jsdom-setup.js polyfills

### Issue: Tests timeout

**Solution**: Add `--runInBand` flag for integration tests:

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```
