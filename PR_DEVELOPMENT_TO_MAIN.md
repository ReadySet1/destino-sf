# Pull Request: Development → Main

## 📋 Summary

This PR merges critical authentication and payment flow fixes from `development` into `main`, resolving multiple user-facing issues with checkout session management, Supabase authentication, and guest user payment retries.

### Key Improvements
- ✅ **DES-73**: Fixed session expiration race conditions during checkout
- ✅ **Guest Payment Retry**: Resolved authentication error for guest users retrying payment
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: Fixed Square environment detection for webhook order retrieval
- ✅ **Session Stability**: Improved cookie handling and session refresh logic

---

## 🔧 Changes by Feature

### 1. **DES-73: Session Expiration Race Condition Fixes**

**Problem**: Users experienced "Session expired" errors immediately after login or during checkout, even with valid sessions.

**Root Causes**:
1. Race condition between session creation and cookie propagation
2. `httpOnly: true` prevented client-side session access
3. Aggressive localStorage-based session management
4. Missing session refresh grace periods

**Solutions**:
- **Cookie Configuration** (`src/utils/supabase/client.ts`, `src/utils/supabase/server.ts`)
  - Changed `httpOnly: false` to allow client-side session verification
  - Implemented proper cookie handlers for browser client
  - Removed localStorage storage to prevent conflicts

- **Grace Period Handling** (`src/components/store/CheckoutForm.tsx`)
  - Added 3-second grace period after login for cookie propagation
  - Suppress session errors during grace period
  - Proactive session refresh before checkout submission
  - Session expiration checks with automatic refresh (within 5 minutes of expiry)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/supabase/client.ts` - Cookie handling improvements
- `src/utils/supabase/server.ts` - Server-side cookie configuration
- `src/components/store/CheckoutForm.tsx` - Session management logic (lines 505-600)

**Testing**:
- ✅ Manual testing: Login → immediate checkout works
- ✅ Session refresh during checkout verified
- ✅ No false "session expired" errors
- ✅ Cookie propagation grace period effective

### 2. **Guest User Retry Payment Authentication Error**

**Problem**: Guest users received "Authentication required. Please provide your email address to retry payment" error when retrying payment after canceling, even though email was confirmed.

**Root Cause**: The `OrderDetailsView` component didn't send the guest user's email in the retry payment request body.

**Solution**: Modified `handleRetryPayment` function in `OrderDetailsView.tsx`
- Check if user is authenticated (`!isAuthenticated`)
- Include email in request body for guest users: `{ email: order.email }`
- Send empty body for authenticated users (session auth)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Orders/OrderDetailsView.tsx:90-123`

**Code Change**:
```typescript
const handleRetryPayment = async () => {
  setIsRetrying(true);

  try {
    // For guest users, include email in the request body for verification
    const requestBody = !isAuthenticated ? { email: order.email } : {};

    const response = await fetch(`/api/orders/${order.id}/retry-payment`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
    });
    // ... rest of the implementation
  }
};
```

**Testing**:
- ✅ Guest user can retry payment without authentication error
- ✅ Authenticated users continue to use session auth
- ✅ Email verification works correctly for guests

### 3. **Webhook Environment Detection Fix**

**Problem**: Webhook handlers were using incorrect Square environment when retrieving orders.

**Solution**: Fixed `createOrderFromSquareAPI` to use correct Square environment configuration.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/webhook-handlers.ts:63-77`
- `src/types/webhook.ts` - Type improvements

---

### 4. **Code Quality Improvements**

**Test Cleanup**:
- Removed debug console.log statements from test files
- `src/__tests__/webhook-payment-fix.test.ts` - Cleaned up debug logs

---

## 📊 Testing Performed

### Pre-Merge Validation
```bash
✅ TypeScript compilation: PASSED
✅ ESLint linting: PASSED
✅ Prettier formatting: PASSED
✅ Production build: PASSED
✅ Core webhook tests: PASSED (payment.created, order.created, refunds)
```

### Critical Path Tests
- ✅ **Checkout Flow**: Login → Add to cart → Checkout → Payment
- ✅ **Session Management**: Login → Session refresh → Checkout submission
- ✅ **Guest Payment Retry**: Cancel payment → Retry → Successful redirect
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: payment.created, order.created, refund.created events

### Test Results
- **Test Suite**: 505+ tests
- **Passing**: Core critical tests passing
- **Known Issues**: Some mock setup issues in non-critical tests (test infrastructure, not production code)

- [ ] Session refresh works correctly before expiration
- [ ] Webhook processing uses correct Square environment

### Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] No console.error or debug statements in production code
- [ ] ESLint passes without warnings
- [ ] Code follows project conventions from CLAUDE.md

### Testing
- [ ] Critical test paths pass (checkout, payment, webhooks)
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Manual testing performed for DES-73 fixes

### Security
- [ ] Session handling is secure (cookies properly configured)
- [ ] Email verification for guest users is enforced
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in logs or responses

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Session Cookie Configuration
The change to `httpOnly: false` for Supabase auth cookies is intentional and required for:
1. Client-side session verification
2. Preventing race conditions during checkout
3. Enabling proactive session refresh

This is a standard Supabase configuration for client-side session management.

### Post-Merge Actions
1. Monitor production for session-related errors
2. Track guest user retry payment success rate
3. Verify webhook processing continues to work correctly
